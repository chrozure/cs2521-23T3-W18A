Feedback from Nick based off of assignment 1 style marking:

    - You should have a comment before your functions and
        helper functions briefly explaining what they do

// This function computes f(x)
int f(int x) {

}

    - Do NOT mix up snake_case and camelCase. It doesn't
        matter which one you choose, as long as you
        stick to one and follow the style guide.

        e.g. I saw a variable name that was the_tempTree.
        It should instead be:
            the_temp_tree
            theTempTree
