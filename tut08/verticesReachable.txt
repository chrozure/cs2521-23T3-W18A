A vertex is reachable from a source
if there exists a path from the
source to that vertex.

a. Vertices reachable from 0
    - { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 }

b. Vertices reachable from 1
    - { 1 }

c. Vertices reachable from 5
    - { 1, 5 }

d. Vertices reachable from 6
    - { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }
